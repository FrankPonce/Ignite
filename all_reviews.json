He does talk a LOT and doesn't foster as much discussion, but I think the latter might also be because people stop doing the readings a few weeks in. He does appreciate participation and gives great essay feedback!",

He loves getting feedback from students and is very accessible to help on any assignment or moral dilemma.  He gives take homes which eat up your entire weekend but he really makes you think and respects your ideas.  I would recommend him to anyone.",

He tried out a funky grading style on our class which required a lot of work, but my writing has improved exponentially as a result. He'll talk you through the entire paper if you're having trouble writing it too.  He's great in class too, he's funny and brilliant. Highly recommend!",

She's also kind cute for a 50 year old( she has excellent fashion).   You will learn a ton, and it's not hard to do well(I thought the grading scale was actually too easy).  Course Grade: A",
